Don’t get hung up on things that don’t fucking work. Fuck. What’s important is the fucking drive to see a project through no matter what. Never, never assume that what you have achieved is fucking good enough. If you’re not being fucking honest with yourself how could you ever hope to communicate something meaningful to someone else? Nothing of value comes to you without fucking working at it. Learn from fucking criticism. When you sit down to work, external critics aren’t the enemy. It’s you who you must to fight against to do great fucking work. You must overcome yourself. Form follows fucking function. Design as if your fucking life depended on it. Dedicate yourself to lifelong fucking learning. Intuition is fucking important. Why are you fucking reading all of this? Get back to work. A good fucking composition is the result of a hierarchy consisting of clearly contrasting elements set with distinct alignments containing irregular intervals of negative space. Widows and orphans are terrible fucking tragedies, both in real life and definitely in typography. Sometimes it is appropriate to place various typographic elements on the outside of the fucking left margin of text to maintain a strong vertical axis.
